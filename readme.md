## Projeto 1 - Ironhack Bootcamp
# By: Ailton Rafael Dias Junior

This project was based on Konato Izumi with the objective of learning and self-assessment of the Ironhack Bootcamp (delives in just one week).
Currently, it is halfway and with the primary objective accomplished (delivery of a game via Canvas); however, it will be incremented until its completion (which will be with all assets and pokemons incremented).
All assets were taken from https://pokemondb.net/sprites.
